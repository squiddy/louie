louie - gamepad browser control
===============================

Think Steam "Big Picture"-mode control in your browser.

Why? I liked the idea behind the controls. Doesn't matter if it ends up being
useful or not. Take this as a proof-of-concept, it won't be able to hold up
against Steams optimized browser.

--------------

* Chrome/Chromium - Support
* Zoom
* Moving around page
* Highlighting and clicking links
* basic Gamepad API support
